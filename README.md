# Muffins - Laravel with Multiple Frontend Libraries

This is a experimental project on how the Laravel Framework can use both React and Vue in a same project to handle frontend view. Currently only React and Vue is implemented with isolated pages between them, meaning it can't share components between those two libraries.

Still much work to do, and it's pretty much flaky -- dont ever think to use it on production.
